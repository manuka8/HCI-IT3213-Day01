## Pages Included

The Login page includes:
- **Username Text Box**: Users can enter their username.
- **Password Text Box**: Users can enter their password.

### 2. Home Page
The Home page is designed for a Gym and includes:
- **Navigation Buttons**: Buttons for easy navigation within the website (e.g., Services, About Us, etc.).
- **Social Media Icons**: Links to the gym's social media pages.
- **Search Box**: A search functionality for users to find specific content on the site.
- **Cart Icon**: Displays a shopping cart icon for users to view items they wish to purchase.

### Navigation Between Pages
- Once a user successfully logs in on the Login page, they are redirected to the Home page.

## Features
- The pages are linked, ensuring users can easily move from logging in to navigating the Gym's homepage.
- All elements on the pages are interactive, allowing for a realistic simulation of the user experience.

## How to View
1. Open the Axure RP9 file.
2. Preview the pages by clicking on the "Preview" button in Axure RP9.
3. Interact with the login and home pages to experience the flow.

## Future Improvements
- Add additional pages for gym membership details, booking classes, etc.
- Implement further user validation and error messages on the Login page.
